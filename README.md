# Akan Name Generator

## Project Description

This project is a simple web application that generates an Akan name based on a user’s date of birth and gender. Akan names originate from Ghanaian culture, where children are named according to the day of the week they were born.

The application calculates the day of birth and displays the corresponding Akan name.

## Features

* User enters their date of birth
* User selects their gender
* The system calculates the day of the week
* The correct Akan name is displayed instantly

## Technologies Used

* **HTML** – structure of the webpage
* **CSS** – styling and layout
* **JavaScript** – logic, calculations, and user interaction

## How It Works

1. The user fills in the date of birth and selects a gender.
